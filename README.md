=========

A Markov chain-based text generator that trains itself on a single corpus (as of now) and produces a pseudorandom output
based on that chain. Currently, this Markov generator takes words as tokens; in the future, I would like it to use whole
clauses as tokens and be capable of training itself on multiple corpora.
